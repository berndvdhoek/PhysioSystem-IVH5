/**
 * <p>
 * The DAO Factory is an abstract class that provides the functionality for
 * creating data access objects for different data source implementations. A
 * data source can be anything that can hold data, such as a relational
 * database, XML file, flat file, serialized Java objects, or even remote
 * servers. Using this factory, a client can ask to create a specific factory,
 * which in turn can create specific data access objects for the given data
 * source implementation. The DAO's handle the persistent storage of the
 * specific domain class, such as (in this case) a Member, Loan of Reservation.
 * </p><p>
 * Clients can ask this class to create a DAOFactory instance for a specific
 * implementation, based on the classname that is provided. The implementation
 * for the specific data source has to extend from this DAOFactory class.
 * </p>
